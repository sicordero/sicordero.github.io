        "<i>People are like gems, right? They have facets to them and some of them only get exposed within certain relationships.</i>"   - Brennan Lee Mulligan

        There's more than one way to look at a problem. My multi-faceted background allows me to be solution oriented and develop quick risk management plans. I enjoy interdisciplinary project management and showcasing my flexible skillsets.

        Currently, I'm interested in expanding the ways geospatial and geophysical data is visualized and interpreted. As Project Manager and Radar Consultant for the [Visualizing Ice Sheets in Extended Reality](https://pgg.ldeo.columbia.edu/projects/viser) Project, I find myself in a unique situation where I balance the objectivity of management and the passion of an invested stakeholder.
