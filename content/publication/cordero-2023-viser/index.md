abstract: Ice-penetrating radar provides detailed cross-sectional images (radargrams) that can be used to measure ice structure, thickness, surface elevation, and more. These measurements allow researchers to analyze ice-sheet flow and reconstruct ice-sheet history. This method is a staple of the remote sensing, glaciology, and geophysical data-sphere. However, radargrams themselves tend to be large files (up to 1.5GB), and so these data are often reduced to text files of digitized elements such as ice thickness, reflector/layer depth, and surface elevation. In addition, the creation of these digitized elements involves interpretations that are hampered by a loss of geospatial context and orientation. This is in part due to the traditional method of "layer picking" - interpreting and digitizing visual elements within a radargram frame, which is plotted within a 2D window on a flat computer monitor. Updating this methodology could greatly improve the accuracy of radargram interpretation and digitization.  The VISER Team has developed an application for the Meta Quest 2 virtual reality headset that allows users to explore a full dataset of radargrams in geospatial context - preserving proper 3D orientation, resolution of the radargram, and georeferencing. We include surface and bathymetry Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) along with satellite imagery as texture to improve a user's geospatial context of the region and improve their interpretation. The user can translate, rotate, and scale radargram frames, toggle textured datasets, compare other digitized interpretations, and create new interpretations. This allows users to connect observations to physical processes in real-world coordinates (EPSG 3031 and EPSG 3413) and scientific units. The pipeline for this project is modular, using commonly used and free software, and as such can be replicated for other datasets and polar regions. This process also makes these large unwieldy 3D datasets accessible by substantially reducing file sizes without decimating data resolution. While augmented reality and virtual reality are not yet commonplace tools for earth science analysis, our application shows promise for their potential adoption as a future ice-sheet analysis tool by providing a 3D immersive environment for data visualization and interpretation.

summary: Using Virtual Reality (VR) for ice-penetrating radar analysis and reflector interpretation can expand the ablity of a polar researcher by alleviating the mental toll of placing data in 3D geospatial context. By including simple and effective interactions, the researcher can focus on the data itself instead of trying to situate it within the global context of the region. The global context is visualized geospatial data. Poster is available above at PDF link.
