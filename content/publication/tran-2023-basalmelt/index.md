abstract: Ice-shelf mass loss in Antarctica is predominantly controlled by basal melting and calving. The loss of ice shelf mass would reduce its buttressing effect on the grounded ice, potentially enabling more grounded ice mass to discharge into the Southern Ocean. In this project, we focus on investigating basal melting of Ross Ice Shelf (RIS) - the world's largest ice shelf - using a combination of ROSETTA-Ice airborne sounding radar survey, 1D heat transfer model, and the NASA/UCI Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM). We developed a novel approach to relate radar englacial attenuation and ice shelf basal melt rates using a physics model from Holland and Jenkins (1999). Using this approach, we present a map of RIS's basal melt rates and compare this map to those produced using two other attenuation rates calculations. All three maps reveal comparable spatial patterns of basal melting. Higher melt rates are observed along the grounding lines in West RIS and along ice flow lines of Byrd Glacier, while East Ross shows lower rates of basal melt. Interestingly, the ISSM based approach displays low melt rates in the areas near Roosevelt Island, where the other two methods display high melt rates. These disparities highlight the importance of understanding how other non-ocean related processes, e.g., surface mass balance, may affect radar attenuation observations.
