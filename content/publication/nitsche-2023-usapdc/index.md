abstract: Availability and findability of existing data is key for reuse of the data, for open, reproducible science, and for enabling data comparison, compilations and analysis of historical developments. This is especially true for polar regions where logistical challenges and rapid changing environments often result in unique datasets. The US Antarctic Program Data Center (USAP-DC) is a data hub and repository funded by the US National Science Foundation and committed to supporting researchers in their data needs, to preserving valuable Antarctic data, and to making these data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. USAP-DC is a repository for any data collected or created as part of the US Antarctic Program, but also links to datasets at other repositories through dedicated project pages for NSF awards and projects. Datasets are hosted with extensive metadata, which are shared through multiple avenues to maximize findability. This includes text and map-based search interfaces and a browser on the USAP-DC web site. In addition, we offer a REST API for machine access to the metadata. We also share metadata and dataset links through multiple metadata catalog services including the Antarctic Metadata Directory (AMD), DataONE, Polar Federated Search and enable other search engine to harvest schema.org information from our dataset pages. Recently, we developed a dataset metric to provide better feedback for users to improve the FAIRness of their data submissions. We plan to further improve metadata and dataset standards through collaboration with different user communities and provide guidance and templates for dataset submission.
